# Arrow Task Engine (HiveMQ)

This branch provides the machine simulator for the Arrow Task Engine. The simulator is connected to the HiveMQ MQTT broker and can be used to test the Arrow Task Engine data. The simulator is written in Python and uses the [paho-mqtt](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/) library.
